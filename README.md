# Movie Manager

Search for any movie!
This site uses the OMDb API (http://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie details.

Create an account to store a list of your favorite movies.
Don't worry password is hashed before it is stored.

# Suggestion algorthem (comming soon)
Movies will be recommended based on user's favorite list. This will work by looking for common attributes in the list then give a recommendation. For example: if users have a lot of action movies then the recommendation list should recommend action movie.

#Current problem
Omdbapi doesnt allow me to return a list of movies so in movie>list are movies I put in.
